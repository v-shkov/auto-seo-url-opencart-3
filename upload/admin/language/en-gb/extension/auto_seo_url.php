$_['help_auto_seo_url']  = 'The <b>AUTO SEO URL</b> module automatically generates SEO-friendly URLs by transliterating product names.
<br> This module greatly simplifies adding new products to your website, making URLs readable and optimized for search engines.
<br> In the standard OpenCart version, SEO URLs have to be entered manually, which can be inconvenient when managing a large catalog.
<br> With this module, SEO URLs are generated automatically using product name transliteration.
<br> Most free solutions create product URLs only when saving the product manually.
<br> But what if products are imported via CSV, EXCEL, or other automated methods?
<br> In such cases, most modules fail to detect those changes, forcing you to look for ways to generate URLs for imported items.
<br> This module was created specifically to solve that problem — to make administrators’ work easier by allowing bulk URL generation with a single click.
<br> For advanced users, the module also supports automatic URL generation through CRON for products missing an SEO URL.
<br> The module makes product management much easier, allowing you to focus on more important tasks.
<br> Stop wasting time on manual work — choose automatic generation or use the button in the module settings!';
